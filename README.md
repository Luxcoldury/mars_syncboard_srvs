# ROS Services for SyncBoard

To send commands to the [mars_syncboard](https://github.com/Luxcoldury/mars_syncboard) either with `rosservice call` or using `roscpp` from a remote device, you will need this package of service definitions.

[mars_syncboard](https://github.com/Luxcoldury/mars_syncboard) itself also depends on this package for build and execution.

## How to setup

1. Clone this repo to `catkin_ws/src`

2. Simply goto `catkin_ws` then `catkin_make`
